        <h2>What is kake udon?</h2>
        <p>
            Kake Udon (かけうどん) is the most basic form of hot udon noodle soup, made of udon
            <br>noodles sitting in a flavorful dashi based broth. In my opinion, it is most inspiring as it is
            <br>exactly the kind of food that celebrates simplicity.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2⅓ cups dashi (Japanese soup stock)</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp mirin</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>1½ Tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>⅛–¼ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 servings udon noodles</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a medium saucepan, add 2⅓ cups dashi (Japanese soup stock), 1 Tbsp mirin, 1 tsp
                <br>sugar, 1½ Tbsp soy sauce, and ⅛–¼ tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring the broth to a gentle simmer. Once the broth is simmering, remove it from the heat.
                <br>Cover with a lid and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring a large pot of water to a boil. When the water comes to a full rolling boil, add 2
                <br>servings udon noodles and cook according to the package instructions
            </li>
            <li>
                Using chopsticks, stir the noodles so they don't stick to the bottom of the pot.
            </li>
            <li>
                When the noodles are done cooking, drain them in a colander and cool under cold running water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once the noodles are cool enough to touch, use your hands to rinse them well under the
                <br>cold running water to remove the starch and give the noodles a firm texture.
            </li>
        </ol>
