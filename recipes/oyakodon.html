        <h2>What is oyakodon?</h2>
        <p>
            Oyakodon is a delicious traditional Japanese meal consisting of chicken sautéed
            <br>and then cooked in a Japanese broth, and then finished with egg and served
            <br>over rice. It's really easy, filling, and delicious.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into small pieces</li>
            <li>1 onion, cut in half and sliced</li>
            <li>2 cups dashi stock, made with dashi powder</li>
            <li>¼ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons mirin (Japanese rice wine)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>4 cups hot cooked white rice</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook until
                <br>beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Add onion; cook and stir until onion is
                <br>translucent, about 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour in stock, then whisk in soy sauce, mirin, and brown sugar; stir until sugar
                <br>dissolves. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until slightly reduced,
                <br>about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whisk eggs in a bowl until well-beaten, then pour into the hot stock mixture.
                <br>Cover the skillet, reduce the heat, and steam until egg is cooked, about 5
                <br>minutes. Remove from the heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Divide rice among 4 deep soup bowls and top with equal amounts of the soup
                <br>mixture.
            </li>
        </ol>
