    <h2>What is Chicken Katsu?</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken.<br />This is my family
      recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead
      of chicken.<br />Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch
        thickness
      </li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper.<br />Place
        flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes.<br />Coat
        chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg,
        <br />and then press into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.<br />Place chicken in
        the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side.<br />Transfer
        to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
      </li>
    </ol>
