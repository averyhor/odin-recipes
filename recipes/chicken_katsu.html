    <h2 class="sub-header">What is Chicken Katsu?</h2>
    <div class="container">
      <p>
        Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken.<br />This is my family
        recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead
        of chicken.<br />Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.
      </p>

          chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg,
